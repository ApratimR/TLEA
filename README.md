# TLEA (Totally Lame Encryption Algorithm)

<img src="TLEA.png" width="400">

As the Acronym says its a lame , in-progress symmetric key encryption algorithm whoes aim is to 
* be fast
* and question itself why does it exist


Reason i am making this thing :
* i love encryption and the principal behind it
* i love python
* i love to make things go fast and achive its full popential in a non-conventional method

## TODOs

- [x] keygenerator / key expander
- [x] structure generator
- [x] per layer function
- [x] request data again when no input recived
- [x] data padding
- [ ] the reversing function
